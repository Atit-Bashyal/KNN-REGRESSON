# KNN-REGRESSON
SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KNN REGRESSION ALGORITHM. THE REGRESSION FUNCTION IS TRAINED AND TESTED ON BONE-MARROW DATA 
FROM https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/bone.data.
A SIMPLE CROSS-VALIDATION SCHEME IS IMPLEMENTED TO FIND THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF NEIGHBOURS TO USE FOR THE KNN REGRESSION 
ALGORITHM.
